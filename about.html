        <h1>AIB Profile</h1>
        <p>ACLEDA Institute of Business (AIB) was recognized by the Royal Government of Cambodia through a sub decree No 13.Or Nor Kro.Bor Kor dated Jan 25, 2016 as a private higher education institution, transforming from ACLEDA Training Center (ATC) which
            is one of ACLEDA Bank Plc's subsidiary companies as a private limited company.

            <p>Originally, ATC was formed in August 2011 under the Regulations of Commercial Rules and Register Law, Commercial Enterprises Law, Civil Code, and Penal Code of the Kingdom of Cambodia by merging Training Division of ACLEDA Bank Plc. [created
                in 2000, played a crucial role in building the capacity of ACLEDA staff to contribute to the Bank's success over the years] with ACLEDA-ASEAN Regional Microfinance Training Center [established by ACLEDA Bank Plc in 2008 with the generous
                support of the Royal Government of Cambodia, and co-financed by the Federal Republic of Germany through KfW to provide training locally and internationally, focusing on MFIs in the ASEAN Region plus China] and then, it was acknowledged
                by the Ministry of Commerce of the Kingdom of Cambodia as a Single Member Private Limited Company on September 13, 2011 to provide training services to ACLEDA staff as well as local and international participants from other organizations
                and the public (External Participants). To continue its sustainable missions, AIB provides both higher education services on department of business administration and professional training services in field of finance and banking to local
                and international students and graduates, participants from other organizations, and the public as well as ACLEDA Bank's staff.</p>
